    <h1>Pong Game</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my simple yet engaging Pong game project! This project is built using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) and C++, offering a classic arcade experience with a twist.</p>
    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Player Control:</strong> Use the arrow keys to move your paddle up and down.</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Bar:</strong> A bar moves across the screen, changing position and size when objects collide with it.</li>
        <li><strong>Challenging Objects:</strong> Randomly generated objects interact with both you and the bar.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoring:</strong> Survive as long as possible to earn points. Your score increases with each passing frame.</li>
